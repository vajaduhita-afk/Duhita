70th day of working here

Today sir we got to know the blunder we created probably something I'll encounter every now and then, yeah, 
that's when I asked sir, 
how do they make the site? how can it be deleted so easily?
I asked the work structure, he said 1 thing, it is something we are supposed to know
You just make a working structure chart for their work, how can we manage them if we don't know their work itself?
that thing alone made me feel like, I should learn that skill
that's when my resolve got stronger to learn techs, github, and yeah, I have already tried using clickup by myself
but same thing, I need a full data set to start doing that, so this time, I'm doing this completely! 
(this thing aside that i'm having my semester exams within a week)
yeah, I'am gonna learn digital marketing soon, since I got a friend as well, who is ready to teach me :)
